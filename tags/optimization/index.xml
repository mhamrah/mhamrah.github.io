&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href=&#34;http://wp.me/pnRto-aa&#34;&gt;first post on web technology&lt;/a&gt; talks about what we are trying to accomplish when building for the web. There are four ways we can break down the standard flow of &lt;em&gt;client action/server action/result&lt;/em&gt;: delivering, serving, rendering and developing. This post focuses on delivering content by understanding the network. Why use a &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network&#34;&gt;cdn&lt;/a&gt;? What&amp;#8217;s all the fuss about connections and compressed static assets? The network is often overlooked but understanding how it operates is essential for building high performing websites. A 50ms rendering time with a 50ms db query is meaningless if it takes three seconds to download a page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;tcp-know-it:117df65302b8db2107451cddb1557896&#34;&gt;TCP: Know It.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going from client to server and back again rests on the network and how well you use it. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol&#34;&gt;TCP&lt;/a&gt; dominates communication on the web and is worth knowing well. In order to send data from one point to another a connection is established between two points via a back-and-forth handshake. Once established, data flows between the two in a series of packets. TCP offers reliability by acknowledging receipt of every packet sent by sending a second acknowledgement packet back to the server. The time it takes to go from one end to another and back is called latency or round-trip time. At any given time there are packets in flight waiting acknowledgement of receipt. TCP only allows a certain amount of unacknowledged packets in flight; this is called window size. Connections start with small window sizes but as more successful transfers occur the window size will increase (&lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow-start&#34;&gt;known as slow start&lt;/a&gt;). This effectively increases bandwidth because more data is sent at once. The longer the latency the slower a connection; if the window size is full then the server must wait for acknowledgements before sending more data. This is on top of the time it actually takes to send packets. The best case scenario is low latency with large, full windows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;reliability:117df65302b8db2107451cddb1557896&#34;&gt;Reliability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reliable connections are also important; if packets are lost they must be resent. Retransmissions slow down transfers because tcp guarantees in-order delivery of data to the application layer. If a packet is dropped and needs to be resent nothing will be delivered to the application until that one packet is received. UDP, an alternative to TCP, doesn&amp;#8217;t offer the same guarantees and assumes issues are dealt with at the application layer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;a href=&#34;http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/11/14/analyzing-network-characteristics-using-javascript-and-the-dom-part-1/&#34;&gt;good article by Phillip Tellis on understanding the network with JS&lt;/a&gt; which talks about data transfer and TCP. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wireshark.org/&#34;&gt;Wireshark&lt;/a&gt; is another great tool for analyzing packets across a network. You can actually view individual packets as they come and go and see how window size is scaling, view retransmissions, measure bandwidth, and examine latency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-importance-of-connections:117df65302b8db2107451cddb1557896&#34;&gt;The Importance of Connections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Establishing a connection takes time because of the handshake involved and latency considerations. A 100ms latency could mean more than 300ms before any data is even received on top of dealing with any dns lookups and os overhead. Keeping a connection alive avoids this creation overhead. Connection pooling, for example, is a popular technique to manage database connections. A web server will talk to a database frequently; if the connection is already established there is no overhead in executing a new query which can trim valuable time off of serving a request. &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping&#34;&gt;Ping&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traceroute&#34;&gt;traceroute&lt;/a&gt; are two worthwhile tools that examine latency and the &amp;#8220;hops&amp;#8221; packets take from one network to another as they travel from end to end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Connections take time to create, have a relatively limited availability and require overhead to manage. It may seem like a great idea to keep connections open for the long haul, but there is a limited number of connections a server can sustain. Concurrent connections is a popular benchmark which examines how many simultaneous connections can occur at any given time. If you hit that mark, new requests will have to wait until something frees up. The ideal situation is to pump as much as possible through a few connections so there are more available to others. If you can serve multiple files files at once great; but why keep six empty connections open between requests if you don&amp;#8217;t need too?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a side note, this is where server architecture comes into play. A server usually processes a request by building a web page from a framework. If this can be done asynchronously by the web server, or offloaded somewhere else, the web server can handle a higher number of sustained connections. The server can grab a new connection while it waits for data to send on an existing one. We&amp;#8217;ll talk more about this in another post. Fast server times also keep high concurrent connections from arising in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;optimizing-the-network:117df65302b8db2107451cddb1557896&#34;&gt;Optimizing the Network&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowering latency and optimizing data throughput are what dominate delivery optimization. It is important to keep the data which flows between client and server to a minimum. Downloading a 100kb page is a lot faster than downloading a 1000kb page. Compressing static content like css and javascript greatly reduces payload which is why tools like &lt;a href=&#34;http://documentcloud.github.com/jammit/&#34;&gt;Jammit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/closure/&#34;&gt;Google Closure&lt;/a&gt; are so ubiquitous. These tools can also merge files; because of http chatter it is faster to download one larger file than several small files. Remember the importance of knowing http? Each http request requires reusing or establishing a connection, a header request sent, the server handling the request, and the response. Doing this once is better than twice. Most web servers can also dynamically compress http responses and should be used when possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fixing latency can be done by using a content delivery network like &lt;a href=&#34;http://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/&#34;&gt;Amazon Cloudfront&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.akamai.com&#34;&gt;Akamai&lt;/a&gt;. They shorten the distance between a request and response by taking content from your server and spreading it on their infrastructure all over the world. When a user requests a resource the cdn routes the request to the server with the lowest latency. A user in Japan can download a file from Japan a lot faster than he can from Europe. Shorter distance, fewer hops, fewer retransmissions. A good cdn strategy rests on how easy it is to push content to a cdn and how easy it is to refresh it. Both concerns should be well researched when leveraging a cdn. You don&amp;#8217;t want stale css files in the wild when you release a new version of your app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAN_optimization&#34;&gt;WAN accelerator&lt;/a&gt; is also a cool technique. Let&amp;#8217;s say you want to deliver a dynamic web page from the US to Tokyo. You could have that travel over the open internet with a high latency connection. Or you could route that request to a data center in Tokyo with an optimized connection to the US. The user gets a low-latency connection to the Tokyo datacenter which in turn gets a low-latency high bandwidth connection to the US. This can greatly simplify issues with running and keeping multiple data centers in sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-bottom-line:117df65302b8db2107451cddb1557896&#34;&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s a lot of effort underway in making the web faster by changing how tcp connections are leveraged on the web. Http 1.0 requires a new connection for every request/response and browsers limit the number of parallel connections between client and server between two and six. Http keep-alive and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_pipelining&#34;&gt;http pipelining&lt;/a&gt; offer mechanisms to push more content through existing connections. Rails 3.1 introduced http streaming via chunked responses. Browsers can fetch assets in parallel with the main html response as soon as tags appear in the main response stream. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.chromium.org/spdy/spdy-whitepaper&#34;&gt;Spdy&lt;/a&gt;, an effort by Google, is worth checking out: it proposes a multi-pronged attack to leverage as much flow as possible on a single connection. The docs also illustrate interesting pain points with the network on the web. The bottom line is simple: reduce the amount of data that needs to go from one place to another and make the travel time as fast as possible. Small amounts of data over existing parallel connections make a fast web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;This approach shouldn&amp;#8217;t be limited to users and servers; optimizing network communication within your datacenter is extremely important. You have total control over your infrastructure and can tune your network accordingly. You can also choose your communication protocols: using something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://thrift.apache.org/&#34;&gt;thrift&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/&#34;&gt;protocol buffers&lt;/a&gt; can save a tremendous amount of bandwidth over xml-based web services on http.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;dt&gt;:&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.scala-lang.org/&#34;&gt;http://www.scala-lang.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

          <description>

&lt;p&gt;The web technology landscape is huge and growing every day. There are hundreds of options from servers to languages to frameworks for building the next big thing. Is it &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.nginx.org/en/&#34;&gt;nginx&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&#34;http://unicorn.bogomips.org/&#34;&gt;unicorn&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href=&#34;http://rubini.us/&#34;&gt;rubinus&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href=&#34;http://nodejs.org/&#34;&gt;node.js&lt;/a&gt; restful service on &lt;a href=&#34;http://cassandra.apache.org/&#34;&gt;cassandra&lt;/a&gt; running with &lt;a href=&#34;http://emberjs.com/&#34;&gt;ember.js&lt;/a&gt; and html5 on the front end? Should I learn or ? What&amp;#8217;s the best nosql database for a socially powered group buying predicative analysis real-time boutique mobile aggregator that scales to 100 million users and never fails?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is true there are many choices out there but web technology boils down to a very simple premise. You want to respond to a user action as quickly as possible, under any circumstance, while easily changing functionality. Everything from the technology behind this blog to what goes into facebook operates on that simple idea. The problem comes down to doing it at the scale and speed of the modern web. You have hundreds of thousands of users; you have hundreds of thousands of things you want them to see; you want them to buy, share, create, and/or change those things; you want to deliver a beautiful, customized experience; everything that happens needs to be instantaneous; it can never stop working; and the cherry on the cake is that everything is constantly changing; different features, different experiences, different content; different users. The simple &amp;#8220;hello world&amp;#8221; app is easy. But how do you automatically translate that into every language with a personal message and show a real-time graph with historical data of every user accessing the page &lt;em&gt;at scale&lt;/em&gt;? What if we wanted to have users leave messages on the same page? Hopefully by the end of this series you will get a sense of how all the pieces fit together and what&amp;#8217;s involved from going to 10 users to 10 thousand to 10 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-web-at-50-000-feet:ba587cddf41afc4433f829b6dc01b418&#34;&gt;The Web at 50,000 Feet&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The web breaks down to three distinct areas: what happens with the client, what happens on the server, and what happens in between. Usually this is rendering a web page: a user clicks a link, a page delivered, the browser displays the content. It could also involve handling an ajax request, calling an API, posting a search form. Either way it boils down to &lt;em&gt;client action, server action, result&lt;/em&gt;. Doing this within a users attention span given any amount of meaningful content in a fail-safe way with even the smallest amount of variation is why we have all this technology. It all works together to combine flexibility and speed with power and simplicity. The trick is using the right tool in the swiss-army knife of tech to get the job done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s break all this down a bit. Handling a user action well comes down to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Having the server-side handle the request quickly (Serving)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A quick travel time between the client and server (Delivering)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quickly displaying the result (Rendering)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And developing and managing all this successfully comes down to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changing any aspect of what is going on quickly and easily (Developing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As sites grow and come under heavier load doing any one of these things becomes increasingly difficult. More features, more users, more servers, more code. There is only so much one server can do. There is also only so much a server &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to do. Why hit the database if you can cache the result? Why render a page if you don&amp;#8217;t need to? Why download a one meg html page when it&amp;#8217;s only 100kb compressed? Why download a page if you don&amp;#8217;t have to? How do you do all this and keep your code simple? How do you ensure everything still works even if your &lt;a href=&#34;http://aws.amazon.com/message/65648/&#34;&gt;data center goes down&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Http plays an important role in all of this. I didn&amp;#8217;t truly appreciate http until I read &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Restful-Web-Services-Leonard-Richardson/dp/0596529260&#34;&gt;Restful Web Services&lt;/a&gt; by Sam Ruby and Leonard Richardson. Http as an application protocol offers an elegant, scalable mechanism for transferring data and defining intent. Understanding http verbs, various http headers and how http sits on top of tcp/ip can go along way in mastering the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;making-it-all-work-together:ba587cddf41afc4433f829b6dc01b418&#34;&gt;Making it all work together&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do you choose and use all the tools out there to serve, deliver, render and develop for the web? What does &lt;em&gt;client action/server action/result&lt;/em&gt; have to do with &lt;a href=&#34;http://rack.rubyforge.org/&#34;&gt;rack&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface&#34;&gt;wsgi&lt;/a&gt;? I naïvely thought I could write everything I wanted to in a single post: from using &lt;a href=&#34;http://sass-lang.com/&#34;&gt;sass&lt;/a&gt; for compressed, minimized css to sharding databases for horizontal scalability. It will be easier to spread it out a bit so stay tuned. But remember: any language, framework or tool out there is really about improving &lt;em&gt;client action/server action/result&lt;/em&gt;. Even something like &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket&#34;&gt;websockets&lt;/a&gt;. Websockets eliminates the client request completely. Why wait for a user to tell you something when you can push them content? Knowing your problem domain, your bottlenecks, and your available options will help you choose the right tool and make the right time/cost/benefit decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll dig into the constraints and various techniques to effectively &lt;a href=&#34;http://wp.me/pnRto-af&#34;&gt;deliver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://wp.me/pnRto-al&#34;&gt;serve, develop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://wp.me/pnRto-at&#34;&gt;render&lt;/a&gt; for the web in upcoming posts.&lt;/p&gt;
