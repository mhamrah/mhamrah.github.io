        <span class="post-date">Nov 29 2008</span>
        <p><em>Note: This is part of a series on hiring software developers.  See <a title="Interview" href="http://www.michaelhamrah.com/blog/index.php/tag/interview/" target="_self">articles tagged with interview for the series</a>.</em></p>

<p><strong>The Ad</strong></p>

<p>The ad is one of the most important parts of the hiring process, as it sets the tone for who you&#8217;re asking to apply.  If you write a careless, generic ad you&#8217;re going to get generic candidates.  Well, you&#8217;re always going to get generic candidates, but with a generic ad you&#8217;re definitely not going to get any good or great candidates.  It&#8217;s as simple as this: If you want a good developer, you need a good ad.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t take a lot of effort to see the difference between generic ads and good ads.  Just do a simple search of C# on Dice.com and you&#8217;ll see them- bland titles, boring summaries.  Would you apply for these jobs? I don&#8217;t even want to look at them!</p>

<p>Here are some guidelines:**</p>

<p>**</p>

<p><strong>Be proud of the company and the job, and be proud of the work you do.</strong> Show that in the ad, and show why good people will excel at your company. There should be an exciting summary of the company, as well as the job.  It&#8217;s important to put development work in the correct context, and allow people to see how they can fit and contribute.  A good ad will open the door to a positive answer when you ask, &#8220;Why do you want to work for us?&#8221; later.</p>

<p><strong>Don&#8217;t hide your company behind a recruiting agency.</strong> Disclaimer: I hate recruiters.  99 out of 100 times they&#8217;re awful people, shoveling the worst resumes in your face and harassing you.  About half my phone calls are recruiters- and I hang up on all them.  It&#8217;s worthless.  More importantly, quality candidates probably aren&#8217;t going to work with recruiters, because they don&#8217;t need to.  It&#8217;s their market, not yours.  Be open about the company, the job and the work.  A good candidate isn&#8217;t going to apply just because the ad says &#8220;C#/Javascript/Sql Server&#8221;.</p>

<p><strong>Explain about the lifestyle of the company in the ad.</strong> Be somewhat silly, but honest.  People want to feel at home at work- and relaxed.  Show off the perks a little.  This will get people excited about the opportunity, and will make them want it more.</p>

<p><strong>Explain what you&#8217;re really looking for, not just certain skill sets.</strong> If you&#8217;re demanding people know one language or another, you&#8217;re cutting off a lot of your applicant pool, and that&#8217;s bad.  Sure, if you want someone who&#8217;s going to do low-level device driver programming, you can be picky.  But for most things, it doesn&#8217;t matter if a candidate knows C#, PHP, or Java.  A good candidate will learn a new language quickly.  It&#8217;s more important they know the principals of programming.  Explain the skills on a high level- web programming, application architecture, content management systems, social websites- and let the candidate apply their knowledge to your needs.  If they can do that, you&#8217;re golden.</p>

<p><strong>Resumes</strong></p>

<p>Hopefully you&#8217;ll get a lot of resumes- and you may think it&#8217;s hard to separate the good from the bad.  It&#8217;s not- and if you&#8217;re on the fence about somebody, then they&#8217;e a &#8220;NO&#8221;.  Don&#8217;t waste your time!  Here are some tips:</p>

<ol>
<li>You&#8217;re only goal is to see if the candidate is worth a phone call, that&#8217;s it.  You&#8217;re not hiring them based on their resume.</li>
<li>If the have certain items in bold, they&#8217;re no good.  Who bolds items on their resume? I see this all the time.  If you have to bold items in your resume, tailor your resume.</li>
<li>A resume should be one page, two pages max.  If you get an eight page resume, pass.  It&#8217;s all filler.</li>
<li>A candidate should explain how they solved problems at their job.  You&#8217;re hiring a problem solver.  If a candidate writes &#8220;Created user controls and a site map for a website,&#8221; don&#8217;t call them.  That&#8217;s a gimme.  Should they write they double clicked the visual studio icon also? I look for how they applied their knowledge to get things done.  You should too.</li>
<li>Look for typos.  I see a lot of these- even small things, like capitalization errors.  If a candidate isn&#8217;t going to take the time to clean up their resume, they&#8217;re probably going to be sloppy programmers.</li>
<li>I can live with someone specifying every technology since the dawn of man on their resume, but I&#8217;m going to call you out on it.  I really don&#8217;t believe people when I see &#8220;PHP, ASP.NET 1.0/1.<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.0/3.0/3.5, WCF, WWF, WPF,WebForms,Cobol, Java,EJB, Windows Vista, XP, NT, Server, Abacus, Sql Server 7.0/2000/2005/2008&#8243;!  Really? The abacus? You used the abacus at a job?  Somehow, somewhere, someone told candidates to list every possible buzzword on their resume, and people blindly followed.  FYI: Nobody&#8217;s going to say &#8220;Oh, sorry, you didn&#8217;t list VB 6 in your skillset, I&#8217;m not calling you.&#8221;  If they do- don&#8217; worry- you don&#8217;t want to work for them.</li>
</ol>

<p>Luckily, you&#8217;ll be calling about 15% of the resumes you get.  In a tight job market like NYC, maybe 20-25%.  If you hire a lot, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find the resume says a lot about the candidate- and the ones that stand out are easy to spot.  **If you think you&#8217;re not getting any good resumes in, then you&#8217;re writing a poor ad.</p>

        <span class="post-date">Nov 29 2008</span>
        <p><em>Note: This is part of a series on hiring software developers.  See <a title="Interview" href="http://www.michaelhamrah.com/blog/index.php/tag/interview/" target="_self">articles tagged with interview for the series</a>.</em></p>

<p>We just finished a round of recruiting at our company, and I&#8217;m somewhat happy it&#8217;s over.  Hiring software developers, or any other type of employee, is never an easy task.  How do you know you&#8217;re picking the right person? How do you know if they&#8217;re qualified? How do you know they&#8217;ll deliver as well as they interview?  These are all questions we ask ourselves as we&#8217;re harassed by recruiters, rummage over resumes, and get our interview questions ready.  However, I&#8217;ve learned a great deal during this last round of recruiting, and am happy to say it&#8217;s no longer a painful process.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the one liner: If you go into the hiring process without a strategy, like most things, you&#8217;re doomed to fail.  It&#8217;s important to get your strategy down before you even post the job ad.  You need a clear pipeline from start to finish, so you can manage the process easily.  Plus, hiring somebody who&#8217;s part of a team should never be a one person job.  That doesn&#8217;t mean give the bad parts (like phone screenings) to other people.  That means getting your team involved- and allowing them to give critical feedback on a candidate.  It&#8217;s easy to do that if you have a strategy that allows clear benchmarks when comparing candidates.</p>

<p>We break our hiring pipeline into three major parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Phone Interview</li>
<li>The In House Interview</li>
<li>The Follow Up Interview</li>
</ol>

<p>I&#8217;ll dig into each part in later posts, but it&#8217;s important to note it all starts with getting resumes in the first place-  and that requires a solid ad.  You&#8217;re not only announcing the job position, but you&#8217;re selling yourself to the world.  The ad, as well as resumes, will be the subject of our next post.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>
