  <h1 class="post-title">Using Typesafe’s Config for Scala (and Java) for Application Configuration</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Feb 23 2014</span>
  

<p>I recently leveraged <a href="https://github.com/typesafehub/config">Typesafe&#8217;s Config</a> library to refactor configuration settings for a project. I was very pleased with the API and functionality of the library.</p>

<p>The documentation is pretty solid so there&#8217;s no need to go over basics. One feature I like is the clear hierarchy when specifying configuration values. I find it helpful to put as much as possible in a reference.conf file in the /resources directory for an application or library. These can get overridden in a variety of ways, primarily by adding an application.conf file to the bundled output&#8217;s classpath. The <a href="https://github.com/sbt/sbt-native-packager">sbt native packager</a>, helpful for deploying applications, makes it easy to attach a configuration file to an output. This is helpful if you have settings which you normally wouldn&#8217;t want to use during development, say using remote actors with akka. I find placing a reasonable set of defaults in a reference.conf file allows you to easily transport a configuration around while still overriding it as necessary. Otherwise you can get into copy and paste hell by duplicating configurations across multiple files for multiple environments.</p>

<h2 id="alternative-overrides:25b0f7af66c88453ba07c790c20bec8d">Alternative Overrides</h2>

<p>There are two other interesting ways you can override configuration settings: using environment variables or java system properties. The environment variable approach comes in very handy when pushing to cloud environments where you don&#8217;t know what a configuration is beforehand. Using the ${?VALUE} pattern a property will only be set if a value exists. This allows you to provide an option for overriding a value without actually having to specify one.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s an example in a conf file using substitution leveraging this technique:</p>

<pre><code>http {
 port = 8080
 port = ${?HTTP_PORT}
}
</code></pre>

<p>We&#8217;re setting a default port of 8080. If the configuration can find a valid substitute it will replace the port value with the substitute; otherwise, it will keep it at 8080. The configuration library will look up its hierarchy for an HTTP_PORT value, checking other configuration files, Java system properties, and finally environment variables. Environment variables aren&#8217;t perfect, but they&#8217;re easy to set and leveraged in a lot of places. If you leave out the ? and just have ${HTTP_PORT} then the application will throw an exception if it can&#8217;t find a value. But by using the ? you can override as many times as you want. This can be helpful when running apps on Heroku where environment variables are set for third party services.</p>

<h3 id="using-java-system-properties:25b0f7af66c88453ba07c790c20bec8d">Using Java System Properties</h3>

<p>Java system properties provide another option for setting config values. The shell script created by sbt-native-packager supports java system properties, so you can also set the http port via the command line using the -D flag:</p>

<pre><code>bin/bash_script_from_native_packager -Dhttp.port=8081
</code></pre>

<p>This can be helpful if you want to run an akka based application with a different log level to see what&#8217;s going on in production:</p>

<pre><code>bin/some_akka_app_script -Dakka.loglevel=debug
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately sbt run doesn&#8217;t support java system properties so you can&#8217;t tweak settings with the command line when running sbt. The <a href="https://github.com/spray/sbt-revolver">sbt-revolver</a> plugin, which allows you to run your app in a forked JVM, does allow you to pass java arguments using the command line. Once you&#8217;re set up with this plugin you can change settings by adding your Java overrides after <code>---</code>:</p>

<pre><code>re-start --- -Dhttp.port=8081
</code></pre>

<h3 id="with-c3p0:25b0f7af66c88453ba07c790c20bec8d">With c3p0</h3>

<p>I was really excited to see that the <a href="http://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#c3p0_conf">c3p0 connection pool library also supports Typesafe Config</a>. So you can avoid those annoying xml-based files and merge your c3p0 settings directly with your regular configuration files. I&#8217;ve migrated an application to a <a href="docker.io">docker</a> based development environment and used this c3p0 feature with <a href="http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/use/working_with_links_names/">docker links</a> to set mysql settings:</p>

<pre><code>app {
 db {
  host = localhost
  host = ${?DB_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR}
  port = &quot;3306&quot;
  port = ${?DB_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT}
 }
}

c3p0 {
 named-configs {
  myapp {
      jdbcUrl = &quot;jdbc:mysql://&quot;${app.db.host}&quot;:&quot;${app.db.port}&quot;/MyDatabase&quot;
  }
 }
}
</code></pre>

<p>When I link a mysql container to my app container with <code>--link mysql:db</code> Docker will inject the DB_PORT_3306_TCP_* environment variables which are pulled by the above settings.</p>

<h3 id="accessing-values-from-code:25b0f7af66c88453ba07c790c20bec8d">Accessing Values From Code</h3>

<p>One other practice I like is having a single &#8220;Config&#8221; class for an application. It can be very tempting to load a configuration node from anywhere in your app but that can get messy fast. Instead, create a config class and access everything you need through that:</p>

<pre><code>object MyAppConfig {
  private val config =  ConfigFactory.load()

  private lazy val root = config.getConfig(&quot;my_app&quot;)

  object HttpConfig {
    private val httpConfig = config.getConfig(&quot;http&quot;)

    lazy val interface = httpConfig.getString(&quot;interface&quot;)
    lazy val port = httpConfig.getInt(&quot;port&quot;)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Type safety, Single Responsibility, and no strings all over the place.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion:25b0f7af66c88453ba07c790c20bec8d">Conclusion</h3>

<p>When dealing with configuration think about what environments you have and what the actual differences are between those environments. Usually this is a small set of differing values for only a few properties. Make it easy to change just those settings without changing&#8211;or duplicating&#8211;anything else. This could done via environment variables, command line flags, even loading configuration files from a url. Definitely avoid copying the same value across multiple configurations: just distill that value down to a lower setting in a hierarchy. By minimizing configuration files you&#8217;ll be making your life a lot easier.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re developing an app for distribution, or writing a library, providing a well-documented configuration file (<a href="https://github.com/spray/spray/blob/master/spray-can/src/main/resources/reference.conf">spray&#8217;s spray-can reference.conf is an excellent example</a>) you can allow users to override defaults easily in a manner that is suitable for them and their runtimes.</p>
