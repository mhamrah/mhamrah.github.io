_Note: This is part of a series on hiring software developers.  See <a title="Interview" href="http://www.michaelhamrah.com/blog/index.php/tag/interview/" target="_self">articles tagged with interview for the series</a>._ 

We just finished a round of recruiting at our company, and I&#8217;m somewhat happy it&#8217;s over.  Hiring software developers, or any other type of employee, is never an easy task.  How do you know you&#8217;re picking the right person? How do you know if they&#8217;re qualified? How do you know they&#8217;ll deliver as well as they interview?  These are all questions we ask ourselves as we&#8217;re harassed by recruiters, rummage over resumes, and get our interview questions ready.  However, I&#8217;ve learned a great deal during this last round of recruiting, and am happy to say it&#8217;s no longer a painful process.

Here&#8217;s the one liner: If you go into the hiring process without a strategy, like most things, you&#8217;re doomed to fail.  It&#8217;s important to get your strategy down before you even post the job ad.  You need a clear pipeline from start to finish, so you can manage the process easily.  Plus, hiring somebody who&#8217;s part of a team should never be a one person job.  That doesn&#8217;t mean give the bad parts (like phone screenings) to other people.  That means getting your team involved- and allowing them to give critical feedback on a candidate.  It&#8217;s easy to do that if you have a strategy that allows clear benchmarks when comparing candidates.

We break our hiring pipeline into three major parts:

  1. The Phone Interview
  2. The In House Interview
  3. The Follow Up Interview

I&#8217;ll dig into each part in later posts, but it&#8217;s important to note it all starts with getting resumes in the first place-  and that requires a solid ad.  You&#8217;re not only announcing the job position, but you&#8217;re selling yourself to the world.  The ad, as well as resumes, will be the subject of our next post.

Stay tuned!
