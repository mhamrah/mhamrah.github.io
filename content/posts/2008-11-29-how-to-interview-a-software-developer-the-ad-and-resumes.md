**The Ad**

The ad is one of the most important parts of the hiring process, as it sets the tone for who you&#8217;re asking to apply.  If you write a careless, generic ad you&#8217;re going to get generic candidates.  Well, you&#8217;re always going to get generic candidates, but with a generic ad you&#8217;re definitely not going to get any good or great candidates.  It&#8217;s as simple as this: If you want a good developer, you need a good ad.

It doesn&#8217;t take a lot of effort to see the difference between generic ads and good ads.  Just do a simple search of C# on Dice.com and you&#8217;ll see them- bland titles, boring summaries.  Would you apply for these jobs? I don&#8217;t even want to look at them!

Here are some guidelines:**
  
** 

**Be proud of the company and the job, and be proud of the work you do.** Show that in the ad, and show why good people will excel at your company. There should be an exciting summary of the company, as well as the job.  It&#8217;s important to put development work in the correct context, and allow people to see how they can fit and contribute.  A good ad will open the door to a positive answer when you ask, &#8220;Why do you want to work for us?&#8221; later.

**Don&#8217;t hide your company behind a recruiting agency.** Disclaimer: I hate recruiters.  99 out of 100 times they&#8217;re awful people, shoveling the worst resumes in your face and harassing you.  About half my phone calls are recruiters- and I hang up on all them.  It&#8217;s worthless.  More importantly, quality candidates probably aren&#8217;t going to work with recruiters, because they don&#8217;t need to.  It&#8217;s their market, not yours.  Be open about the company, the job and the work.  A good candidate isn&#8217;t going to apply just because the ad says &#8220;C#/Javascript/Sql Server&#8221;.

**Explain about the lifestyle of the company in the ad.** Be somewhat silly, but honest.  People want to feel at home at work- and relaxed.  Show off the perks a little.  This will get people excited about the opportunity, and will make them want it more.

**Explain what you&#8217;re really looking for, not just certain skill sets.** If you&#8217;re demanding people know one language or another, you&#8217;re cutting off a lot of your applicant pool, and that&#8217;s bad.  Sure, if you want someone who&#8217;s going to do low-level device driver programming, you can be picky.  But for most things, it doesn&#8217;t matter if a candidate knows C#, PHP, or Java.  A good candidate will learn a new language quickly.  It&#8217;s more important they know the principals of programming.  Explain the skills on a high level- web programming, application architecture, content management systems, social websites- and let the candidate apply their knowledge to your needs.  If they can do that, you&#8217;re golden.

**Resumes**

Hopefully you&#8217;ll get a lot of resumes- and you may think it&#8217;s hard to separate the good from the bad.  It&#8217;s not- and if you&#8217;re on the fence about somebody, then they&#8217;e a &#8220;NO&#8221;.  Don&#8217;t waste your time!  Here are some tips:

  1. You&#8217;re only goal is to see if the candidate is worth a phone call, that&#8217;s it.  You&#8217;re not hiring them based on their resume.
  2. If the have certain items in bold, they&#8217;re no good.  Who bolds items on their resume? I see this all the time.  If you have to bold items in your resume, tailor your resume.
  3. A resume should be one page, two pages max.  If you get an eight page resume, pass.  It&#8217;s all filler.
  4. A candidate should explain how they solved problems at their job.  You&#8217;re hiring a problem solver.  If a candidate writes &#8220;Created user controls and a site map for a website,&#8221; don&#8217;t call them.  That&#8217;s a gimme.  Should they write they double clicked the visual studio icon also? I look for how they applied their knowledge to get things done.  You should too.
  5. Look for typos.  I see a lot of these- even small things, like capitalization errors.  If a candidate isn&#8217;t going to take the time to clean up their resume, they&#8217;re probably going to be sloppy programmers.
  6. I can live with someone specifying every technology since the dawn of man on their resume, but I&#8217;m going to call you out on it.  I really don&#8217;t believe people when I see &#8220;PHP, ASP.NET 1.0/1.1/2.0/3.0/3.5, WCF, WWF, WPF,WebForms,Cobol, Java,EJB, Windows Vista, XP, NT, Server, Abacus, Sql Server 7.0/2000/2005/2008&#8243;!  Really? The abacus? You used the abacus at a job?  Somehow, somewhere, someone told candidates to list every possible buzzword on their resume, and people blindly followed.  FYI: Nobody&#8217;s going to say &#8220;Oh, sorry, you didn&#8217;t list VB 6 in your skillset, I&#8217;m not calling you.&#8221;  If they do- don&#8217; worry- you don&#8217;t want to work for them.

Luckily, you&#8217;ll be calling about 15% of the resumes you get.  In a tight job market like NYC, maybe 20-25%.  If you hire a lot, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find the resume says a lot about the candidate- and the ones that stand out are easy to spot.  **If you think you&#8217;re not getting any good resumes in, then you&#8217;re writing a poor ad.
