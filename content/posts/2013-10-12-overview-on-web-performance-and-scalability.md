I recently gave a talk to some junior developers on performance and scalability. The talk is relatively high-level, providing an overview of non-programming topics which are important for performance and scalability. The [original deck is here][1] and on [speaker deck][2].

A few months ago I also [gave a talk on spdy][3] which is also on [speaker deck][4].
