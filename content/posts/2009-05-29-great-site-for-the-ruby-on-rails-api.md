I came across this great site for the Ruby on Rails API:  [http://railsapi.com][1]

[Here&#8217;s a link to Ruby 2.3.2.1 with Ruby 1.9.][2] Why is this great? It has a slick interface with a fast AJAX powered search filter.  From a UI perspective, it makes great use of whitespace and font sizing to present information clearly and legibly.  Finally, the simplistic color scheme is easy on the eyes.  Also includes links for source and github.

Bookmark it!
