I pushed a major update to the MVC3/Html5 Boilerplate Template found on the [github][1] page. The new update includes the latest boilerplate code and uses the DotnetOpenAuth CTP for logging in via Twitter and Facebook. Thanks to [@jacob4u2][2] for making some necessary web.config changes (he has an alternate template on his [bitbucket][3] site you should also check out.

Your best option is to <code class="syntax bash">git clone git@github.com:mhamrah/Html5OpenIdTemplate.git</code> the template with your own app. That way you&#8217;ll get the latest nu-get packages with the bundle. You can also use the template, but you&#8217;ll need to manually pull [the latest CTP for DotNetOpenAuth][4] to get the latest dlls.
