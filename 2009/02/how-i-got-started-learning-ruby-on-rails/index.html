<h3 id="the-hardware-software-setup-1:07a84db2bfd60e17f47a574617953835">The Hardware/Software Setup</h3>

<p>I use a MacBook Pro.  It&#8217;s pretty easy to get setup with Rails on a Mac.  Google for the how-to.  For an editor, I use <a href="http://www.macromates.com">Textmate</a> and love it. (Especially after watching the Peepcode screencast).  I played around with]<a href="http://www.aptana.com">13</a> and <a href="http://www.netbeans.com">NetBeans</a>, but stopped using them both.  It&#8217;s not worth it if you&#8217;re just starting out- these two programs are good IDE&#8217;s, but they wrap a lot of functionality that I&#8217;m finding is just easier to do on the command line.  Get comfortable with the simple first and add what you feel you&#8217;re missing.  On Windows, I&#8217;ve played around with <a href="http://www.e-texteditor.com/">e Text Editor</a> and found it pretty nice.</p>

<p>IDE&#8217;s are very important.  As a .NET developer, I love Visual Studio.  It&#8217;s awesome- I love the intellisense, resharper, the immediate window, debugging, tfs integration, I&#8217;m spoiled.  You can pry code completion from my cold, dead hands.  I wanted that in Rails IDE.  But don&#8217;t try finding Visual Studio for Rails- Rails doesn&#8217;t need Visual Studio, and it will just get in the way.  Everything you need to do can be done in a simple text editor and the terminal window.  When you feel like you&#8217;re lacking something, there&#8217;s an easy way to do it.  Different is okay.</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t want to spend money, check out <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscasts</a>.  These are done by the same people from peepcode and offer shorter videos on specific topics.  Well worth it.  (For those .NET people, think of <a href="http://dimecasts.net/">Dimecasts</a>).</p>

<h3 id="the-hardware-software-setup-3:07a84db2bfd60e17f47a574617953835">The Hardware/Software Setup</h3>

<p>I use a MacBook Pro.  It&#8217;s pretty easy to get setup with Rails on a Mac.  Google for the how-to.  For an editor, I use <a href="http://www.macromates.com">Textmate</a> and love it. (Especially after watching the Peepcode screencast).  I played around with]<a href="http://www.aptana.com">13</a> and <a href="http://www.netbeans.com">NetBeans</a>, but stopped using them both.  It&#8217;s not worth it if you&#8217;re just starting out- these two programs are good IDE&#8217;s, but they wrap a lot of functionality that I&#8217;m finding is just easier to do on the command line.  Get comfortable with the simple first and add what you feel you&#8217;re missing.  On Windows, I&#8217;ve played around with <a href="http://www.e-texteditor.com/">e Text Editor</a> and found it pretty nice.</p>

<p>IDE&#8217;s are very important.  As a .NET developer, I love Visual Studio.  It&#8217;s awesome- I love the intellisense, resharper, the immediate window, debugging, tfs integration, I&#8217;m spoiled.  You can pry code completion from my cold, dead hands.  I wanted that in Rails IDE.  But don&#8217;t try finding Visual Studio for Rails- Rails doesn&#8217;t need Visual Studio, and it will just get in the way.  Everything you need to do can be done in a simple text editor and the terminal window.  When you feel like you&#8217;re lacking something, there&#8217;s an easy way to do it.  Different is okay.</p>
