  <h1 class="post-title">Organizing Javascript for Event Pooling with jQuery</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Dec 21 2009</span>
  

<p>It turns out my most popular article of the past year was <a href="http://www.michaelhamrah.com/blog/index.php/2008/12/event-pooling-with-jquery-using-bind-and-trigger-managing-complex-javascript/">Event Pooling with jQuery&#8217;s Bind and Trigger</a>.&nbsp; I wanted to write a follow up article taking this approach one step further by discussing how to logically organize the relationship between binders and triggers on a javascript heavy UI.&nbsp; It&#8217;s important to properly design the code structure of your javascript to create a flexible and maintainable system.&nbsp; This is essential for any software application. &nbsp;For javascript development, you don&#8217;t want to end up with odd dependencies hindering changes or randomly bubbled events causing bugs.</p>

<h3 id="event-pooling-a-quick-review:b1aa778a626daa40c556fbd74954875f">Event Pooling: A Quick Review</h3>

<p>What is event pooling and why is it important?&nbsp; Quite simply it&#8217;s a way to manage dependencies.&nbsp; You create a loosely coupled system between the thing which triggers an action to happen and the thing which responds to the action, called the binder.&nbsp; jQuery has some cool bind and trigger functionality which allows you to create custom events for event pooling- and you can use this to easily wire up multiple functions to write complex javascript with ease.&nbsp; I encourage you to check out the original how-to article <a href="../index.php/2008/12/event-pooling-with-jquery-using-bind-and-trigger-managing-complex-javascript/">Event Pooling with jQuery&#8217;s Bind and Trigger</a> to learn more. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a very powerful technique.</p>

<p>Now, as we all know, with great power comes great responsibility.&nbsp; If you structure the relationship between binders and triggers incorrectly you&#8217;ll end up with a mess on your hands, a spider web of logic which is almost impossible to unwind.&nbsp; Here are some tips to better structure your binders and triggers for a logical and maintainable application</p>

<h3 id="presenting-the-problem:b1aa778a626daa40c556fbd74954875f">Presenting the Problem</h3>

<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/www.michaelhamrah.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Stupid-Form1.png"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-292" title="Stupid Form" src="http://i1.wp.com/www.michaelhamrah.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Stupid-Form1-300x179.png?resize=300%2C179" alt="Stupid Form" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a></p>

<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at an example app. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s a simple form where a user can draft a report, save it for later, or send it immediately. There are three options to enter data in the name/email/department field.&nbsp; The user can enter it manually, choose from the autosuggest area at left, or simply select one of the favorite links.&nbsp; The autosuggest/favorite link would pre-populate the textboxes used in the form. &nbsp;If all the data is there, the send button is enabled. &nbsp;If not, it&#8217;s disabled.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s discuss how we&#8217;d deal with enabling and disabling the send button. &nbsp;There are many ways to approach this. &nbsp;A traditional way is to wire up some standard event to our textboxes:</p>

<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">$('#name').keyup(function(){
    //Logic (hopefully structured in a reusable way across all controls).
});
//Do this for all other input controls.
</pre>

<p>This solution is perfectly valid and works, but it has some shortcomings. &nbsp;First, you need to wire up all three controls and route them to the same function. &nbsp;Next, even though the keyup will handle user input, the textboxes could change in other ways- either from the favorite link or the auto suggest box. &nbsp;We&#8217;ll need to call our validation function in numerous places. &nbsp;There may also be other logic we want to incorporate within the text change event unrelated to enabling of the send button- email validation, for instance, which is only applicable to the email textbox, or a certain length requirement on the name textbox. &nbsp;What happens if there&#8217;s a new requirement where the subject/body must be filled to enable the send button? Where does all this functionality fall into our larger requirements?</p>

<p>You can imagine the complexity of writing the javascript required for this UI. &nbsp;We need a slew of functions to deal with validation logic: Both for enabling the send button and other input controls. &nbsp;We need to wire up all our onkeyup and on click events across the auto suggest field, textboxes, and favorite links. &nbsp;Function calls are everywhere. &nbsp;It will take all your code complete skills to manage those dependencies and keep this code lean.</p>

<p>This is where event pooling comes into play: instead of direct dependencies between these controls and logic, you bubble events to a middle man and allow interested parties to respond accordingly. &nbsp;Instead of all the controls telling the send button to enable/disable itself, the send button &#8220;listens&#8221; for changes it cares about- when the value of the textbox changes- and responds accordingly. &nbsp;The responsibility is reversed- the function which needs to be called can choose when it&#8217;s called, rather than waiting for something to call it.</p>

<h3 id="dependencies-between-binders-and-triggers:b1aa778a626daa40c556fbd74954875f">Dependencies Between Binders and Triggers</h3>

<p>With event pooling there are two things you need to be conscience of:&nbsp; the events themselves and the data passed between the binder and trigger.&nbsp; These items form the two dependencies between binders and triggers.&nbsp; The event serves as a link between the binder and trigger and the data is the information which is passed between the two.&nbsp; It&#8217;s essential to properly structure your events and choose the right data transfer option to avoid pitfalls over the life of the application.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll deal with each aspect individually. &nbsp;This post will be about the structure of events, and I&#8217;ll write various ways to pass data between parties in another post.</p>

<h3 id="structuring-custom-events:b1aa778a626daa40c556fbd74954875f">Structuring Custom Events</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;">Most people are familiar with the standard javascript events: click, blur, enter, exit, etc.&nbsp; These are what you usually wire up to functions when you want to do something.&nbsp; However, they only go so far- you need custom events when you have a lot of stuff happening. &nbsp;Why use them?&nbsp; Quite simply, it&#8217;s more logical for your application control flow. &nbsp;For our send button functionality, we want our validation function to act when something happens. &nbsp;This &#8220;something&#8221; will be a custom event we create. &nbsp;We have two options for naming our event: we can name the event after what is intended, like &#8220;ENABLE_DISABLE_SEND_BUTTON&#8221;, or name the event after what has happened, like &#8220;NAME_CHANGED&#8221; or &#8220;FAVORITE_LINK_SELECTED&#8221;. &nbsp;The former option requires multiple events to be fired when something happens. &nbsp;The autosuggest box, for instance, would require the ENABLE_DISABLE_SEND_BUTTON trigger, a SELECTED_CONTACT event for setting the textboxes, and whatever else happens after a contact is selected. &nbsp;The latter option requires just one trigger to be fired, but the binder must subscribe to multiple events. &nbsp;The choice can also be presented like this: do we want each element to fire a trigger for each action which should occur, or have a function to listen for multiple triggered events?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://i0.wp.com/www.michaelhamrah.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Event_Pooling-2-e1261347350823.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-300" title="Event_Pooling-2" src="http://i0.wp.com/www.michaelhamrah.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Event_Pooling-2-e1261347350823.png?resize=600%2C317" alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" /></a><br /> </span></p>

<p>Naming events may seem like an arbitrary and thoughtless act, but it&#8217;s essential to have a naming strategy with event pooling. &nbsp;Just like wiring up functions directly can be unwieldy, so can a slew of events wired up every which way.</p>

<p><strong>For event pooling, it&#8217;s more important to name events after what has happened, rather than what is intended.</strong> So the correct approach is to go with things like &#8220;NAME_CHANGED&#8221;, &#8220;CONTACT_SELECTED&#8221;, or &#8220;EMAIL_CHANGED&#8221;. &nbsp;The rationale has to do with dependencies themselves: &nbsp;we don&#8217;t want functions called from random parts of the system via specific events: &nbsp;this is no better than calling functions directly from disparate parts of the system. &nbsp;And with specific action related events like &#8220;ENABLE_SEND&#8221; you just know someone is going to take a shortcut and wire some random binder to a totally unrelated trigger, because that trigger is fired from the control they want to monitor. &nbsp;Binders- and the functions they are wired to- should proactively &#8220;listen&#8221; for things which it&#8217;s interested in. &nbsp;This allows you to easily know why a function is being called. &nbsp;If you need to change why or how something is handled, you go to the recipient, not the caller. &nbsp;The caller, after all, could be anything, and more importantly the caller could be triggering multiple things.</p>

<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">//Funnel all possibilities to single custom trigger
$('#name').bind('keyup enter', function() {
 $(document).trigger('NAME_CHANGED');
});

//Funnel all possibilites to single custom trigger
$('#email').bind('keyup enter', function() {
$(document).trigger('EMAIL_CHANGED');
});

//I know why this is being called because I've subscribed
//to the events I'm interested in.
$(document).bind('NAME_CHANGED EMAIL_CHANGED', function()
{
 //Handle validation, etc.
});
</pre>

<p>The cool thing about this approach is there may be something else which will cause an email or name changed event to happen: specifically, when someone has selected a contact from the autosuggest list or a favorite link is selected. &nbsp;You can fire the name_changed event from multiple places and not worry about wiring up any new triggers. &nbsp;The code would look something like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">//Fired from elsewhere
$(document).bind('FAVORITE_LINK_SELECTED', function()
{
  //Handle selection
  //Set Name, Email, etc.
  //Fire event:
  $(document).trigger('EMAIL_CHANGED');
  $(document).trigger('NAME_CHANGED');
});
</pre>

<p>How nice: &nbsp;another part of the system changes the name indirectly, and we don&#8217;t have to worry about hooking anything up because the binder is already subscribed to the NAME_CHANGED event.</p>

<p>Note the name doesn&#8217;t necessarily correspond to a specific element: It&#8217;s not a textbox_name_changed event, nor are any specific html id&#8217;s involved except for wiring up a trigger from a standard keyup event. &nbsp;This is an important difference: we could rename the id&#8217;s, or switch to some other input control, and not have to rewire everything. &nbsp;We don&#8217;t care about the textbox nor that the textbox&#8217;s value has changed. &nbsp;We care that the textbox respresents the name entered or the email address- and we want to know when the name or email has changed. &nbsp;The favorite link clicked is a good example of this nuanced difference. &nbsp;Take a look at the following html:</p>

<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate" title="">&lt;a href='#' id='fav1' class='favorite'&gt;My Favorite 1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href='#' id='fav2' class='favorite'&gt;My Favorite 2&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>

<p>Imagine we&#8217;ve wired the click event to fire a FAVORITE_LINK_SELECTED trigger. &nbsp;With this trigger, we don&#8217;t care that the link with id fav1 or fav2 has been clicked, nor the a.favorite selector has been clicked. &nbsp;We don&#8217;t care about ids or css classes. &nbsp;We care a FAVORITE_LINK_SELECTED event has happened because that&#8217;s what the id fav1 and favorite class represents- the favorite link- and we want to know when that has been selected. &nbsp;We can rename the id, change the class, or even change the entire element. &nbsp;As long as FAVORITE_LINK_SELECTED is fired we&#8217;re good to go. &nbsp;Our custom FAVORITE_LINK_SELECTED trigger is the abstraction which creates the loosely coupled system.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion:b1aa778a626daa40c556fbd74954875f">Conclusion</h3>

<p>One thing I haven&#8217;t discuss is how data is passed from trigger to binder. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the other important dependency between triggers and binders which we&#8217;ll discuss in another post. &nbsp;The important thing to take away is why you&#8217;d want to use custom named events to create a loosely coupled system. &nbsp;For very straightforward pages it&#8217;s probably not worth the overhead- the abstraction isn&#8217;t required. &nbsp;However, in a complex form where there are lots of validation dependencies, or many routes to the same function, or when multiple events can trigger an update- you want to use event pooling. &nbsp;More importantly, you want to think about your strategy when it comes to naming events, because it&#8217;s the description linking the caller and method together. &nbsp;You do not want to code yourself into a corner!</p>
